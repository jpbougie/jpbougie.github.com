<h3 class="project">Dam <em>(<a href="http://github.com/jpbougie/dam"><span class="at">@</span>github</a>)</em></h3>
<p>A Ruby framework to generate activity streams, such as a facebook news feed. Used in a new project, Crop Circle.</p>

<h3 class="project">Sift <em>(<a href="http://github.com/jpbougie/sift"><span class="at">@</span>github</a>)</em></h3>
<p>Created in the context of my Master's final project at Politecnico di Milano, this is a web tool built in Ruby with Sinatra and CouchDB that offers a gmail-like interface to filter and rate different entries. This was used to fetch questions from the Yahoo! Answers database and explore the features extracted using Natural Language libraries and processes.</p>

<h3 class="project">Bee <em>(<a href="http://github.com/jpbougie/bee"><span class="at">@</span>github</a>)</em></h3>
<p>The backend counterpart of Sift, this is a Scala worker-queue client that makes use of couchdb for the storage of tasks and Kestrel as a queue system to post them.</p>
